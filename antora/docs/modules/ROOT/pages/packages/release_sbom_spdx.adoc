= SPDX SBOM Package

Checks different properties of the CycloneDX SBOMs associated with the image being validated.

== Package Name

* `sbom_spdx`

== Rules Included

[#sbom_spdx__allowed]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__allowed[Allowed]

Confirm the SPDX SBOM contains only allowed packages. By default all packages are allowed. Use the "disallowed_packages" rule data key to provide a list of disallowed packages.

*Solution*: Update the image to not use any disallowed package.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package is not allowed: %s`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.allowed`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_spdx/sbom_spdx.rego#L51[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_spdx__allowed_package_external_references]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__allowed_package_external_references[Allowed package external references]

Confirm the SPDX SBOM contains only packages with explicitly allowed external references. By default all external references are allowed unless the "allowed_external_references" rule data key provides a list of type-pattern pairs that forbid the use of any other external reference of the given type where the reference url matches the given pattern.

*Solution*: Update the image to use only packages with explicitly allowed external references.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package %s has reference %q of type %q which is not explicitly allowed%s`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.allowed_package_external_references`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_spdx/sbom_spdx.rego#L74[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_spdx__allowed_package_sources]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__allowed_package_sources[Allowed package sources]

For each of the packages fetched by Hermeto which define externalReferences, verify they are allowed based on the allowed_package_sources rule data key. By default, allowed_package_sources is empty, which means no components with such references are allowed.

*Solution*: Update the image to not use a package from a disallowed source.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package %s fetched by Hermeto was sourced from %q which is not allowed`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.allowed_package_sources`
* Effective from: `2025-02-17T00:00:00Z`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_spdx/sbom_spdx.rego#L170[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_spdx__contains_files]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__contains_files[Contains files]

Check the list of files in the SPDX SBOM is not empty.

*Solution*: Verify the SBOM is correctly identifying the files in the image.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The list of files is empty`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.contains_files`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_spdx/sbom_spdx.rego#L137[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_spdx__contains_packages]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__contains_packages[Contains packages]

Check the list of packages in the SPDX SBOM is not empty.

*Solution*: Verify the SBOM is correctly identifying the package in the image.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The list of packages is empty`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.contains_packages`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_spdx/sbom_spdx.rego#L36[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_spdx__disallowed_package_attributes]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__disallowed_package_attributes[Disallowed package attributes]

Confirm the SPDX SBOM contains only packages without disallowed attributes. By default all attributes are allowed. Use the "disallowed_attributes" rule data key to provide a list of key-value pairs that forbid the use of an attribute set to the given value.

*Solution*: Update the image to not use any disallowed package attributes.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package %s has the attribute %q set%s`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.disallowed_package_attributes`
* Effective from: `2025-02-04T00:00:00Z`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_spdx/sbom_spdx.rego#L216[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_spdx__disallowed_package_external_references]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__disallowed_package_external_references[Disallowed package external references]

Confirm the SPDX SBOM contains only packages without disallowed external references. By default all external references are allowed. Use the "disallowed_external_references" rule data key to provide a list of type-pattern pairs that forbid the use of an external reference of the given type where the reference url matches the given pattern.

*Solution*: Update the image to not use a package with a disallowed external reference.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package %s has reference %q of type %q which is disallowed%s`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.disallowed_package_external_references`
* Effective from: `2024-07-31T00:00:00Z`

[#sbom_spdx__matches_image]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__matches_image[Matches image]

Check the SPDX SBOM targets the image being validated.

*Solution*: The SPDX SBOM associated with the image describes a different image. Verify the integrity of the build system.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Image digest in the SBOM, %q, is not as expected, %q`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.matches_image`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_spdx/sbom_spdx.rego#L152[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_spdx__valid]
=== link:#sbom_spdx__valid[Valid]

Check the SPDX SBOM has the expected format. It verifies the SPDX SBOM matches the 2.3 version of the schema.

*Solution*: Make sure the build process produces a valid SPDX SBOM.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `SPDX SBOM at index %d is not valid: %s`
* Code: `sbom_spdx.valid`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_spdx/sbom_spdx.rego#L15[Source, window="_blank"]
