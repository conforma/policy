= Quay expiration Package

Policies to prevent releasing an image to quay that has a quay expiration date. In Konflux images with an expiration date are produced by "on-pr" build pipelines, i.e. pre-merge CI builds, so this is intended to prevent accidentally releasing a CI build.

== Package Name

* `quay_expiration`

== Rules Included

[#quay_expiration__expires_label]
=== link:#quay_expiration__expires_label[Expires label]

Check the image metadata for the presence of a "quay.expires-after" label. If it's present then produce a violation.

*Solution*: Make sure the image is built without setting the "quay.expires-after" label. This label is usually set if the container image was built by an "on-pr" pipeline during pre-merge CI.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The label 'quay.expires-after' is not allowed`
* Code: `quay_expiration.expires_label`
