# title: Blocking CVE check
# description: >-
#   The SLSA Provenance attestation for the image is inspected to ensure CVEs
#   of certain security levels have not been detected. If detected, this policy
#   rule will fail. By default, only CVEs of critical and high security level
#   cause a failure. This is configurable by the rule data key
#   "restrict_cve_security_levels". The available levels are critical, high,
#    medium, and low.

#   solution: >-
#     Make sure to address any CVE's related to the image. The CVEs are detected
#     by the task that runs a Clair scan and emits a result named `CLAIR_SCAN_RESULT`.
