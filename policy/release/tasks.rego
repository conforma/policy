#   Enterprise Contract expects that a set of tasks were included
#   in the pipeline build for each image to be released.
#   This package includes a set of rules to verify that the expected
#   tasks ran in the pipeline when the image was built.
#   Required tasks are listed by the names given to them within the Tekton
#   Bundle image. Optionally invocation parameter of a Task can be also
#   mandated by including the name and the value in square brackets following
#   the name of the task. For example: ``name[PARAM=val]``. Only single parameter
#   is supported, to assert multiple parameters repeat the required task
#   definition for each parameter seperately.
