# title: SLSA - Source - Version Controlled
# description: >-
#   The SLSA requirement states the following:
#
#   "Every change to the source is tracked in a version control system
#   that meets the following requirements:
#
#     [Change history] There exists a record of the history of changes
#     that went into the revision. Each change must contain: the
#     identities of the uploader and reviewers (if any), timestamps of
#     the reviews (if any) and submission, the change
#     description/justification, the content of the change, and the
#     parent revisions.
#
#     [Immutable reference] There exists a way to indefinitely reference
#     this particular, immutable revision. In git, this is the {repo URL +
#     branch/tag/ref + commit ID}.
#
#   Most popular version control system meet this requirement, such as git,
#   Mercurial, Subversion, or Perforce."
#
#   This package verifies the requirement by asserting the image was built
#   from a git repository.
