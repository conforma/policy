# title: Trusted Artifacts
# description: >-
#   Trusted Artifacts ensure that only trusted Tasks were used from the
#   origin of the source code to the produced image. The chain is
#   constructed by linking specific parameters with results -- ones that
#   are named `*_ARTIFACT` and have values in the form of
#   `sha-256:<digest>`. If a chain of same-valued digests can be formed
#   from the first Task result to the last Task by correlating the
#   digest values of those and any tasks inbetween.
#
#   Trusted Tasks should be producing and using only the files with the
#   same digest. Given this assurance any code injection should be
#   detected by observing a modified digest.
#
#   This allows addition of Tasks on the Pipeline that do not need to be
#   trusted, i.e. custom tasks.
